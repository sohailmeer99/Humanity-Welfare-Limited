                Let’s dive deeply into what are the causes & effects of not having proper information about your desired field 
                of work inflow. Some of the most underdeveloped countries have very low literacy rates and even don’t provide
                 proper educational structures in institutes due to the lack of qualified teachers, academic resources, and systematic
                  flaws {"(e.g., corruption, non-serious activities)"}. The other reason is that students in those countries are facing
                   financial barriers and don’t have access to essential learning resources for their required fields.

             Some of the most underdeveloped countries suffer from housing crises and fail to provide proper residential solutions
              due to the lack of urban planning, land resources, and government support {"(e.g., corruption, non-serious activities)"}.
               The other reason is that people in those regions are facing financial instability and don’t have the means to build or
                afford safe housing.

            <p>Most of the platforms providing housing projects demand high costs. They require expensive materials — needing specialized construction knowledge —
             and should have pre-existing housing infrastructure to implement these projects.
